# Array Split Function

## Purpose of the project
This project contains a function which will split a given array with 0 or more elements into N sub arrays. If the original array cannot be divided by N equally, all sub-arrays will have the same size except the last array part.

### Examples: 
The following array is split into 3: [1,2,3,4,5]
The resulting sub-arrays: [[1,2],[3,4],[5]]

The following array is split into 5: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
The resulting sub-arrays: [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8],[9,10,11]]
